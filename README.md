# Identifying Key Factors Influencing Heart Disease Risk 
## Abstract
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating a deeper understanding of its risk factors. This study aims to identify and analyze key variables influencing heart disease risk. Using a comprehensive dataset that includes demographic and clinical factors, we employed statistical methods and econometrics to assess the impact of each variable on being in a group of people with potential heart disease. Apart from the features in the dataset, we focused on feature engineering to find another relevant variables in order to increase explanatory power of the model. The key part of the empirical research is the Probit model that was estimated to verify two hypotheses – main hypothesis about the influence of age of individual on probability of heart disease and alternative hypothesis referring to the influence of specific chest pain type on the probability of observing heart disease. According to specific measures, the model enables to predict about 85,2% of the observations correctly. To quantitatively interpret the coefficients we calculated two types of marginal effects – marginal effects for mean observation and average marginal effects.
